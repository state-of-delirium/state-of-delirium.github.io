    Delirium is a specific state of acute confusion attributable to the direct physiological consequence of a medical condition, effects of a psychoactive substance, or multiple causes, which usually develops over the course of hours to days.
    As a syndrome, delirium presents with disturbances in attention, awareness, and higher-order cognition.
    People with delirium may experience other neuropsychiatric disturbances including changes in psychomotor activity, disrupted sleep-wake cycle, emotional disturbances, disturbances of consciousness, or altered state of consciousness, as well as perceptual disturbances, although these features are not required for diagnosis
